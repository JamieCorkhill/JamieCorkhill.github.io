      <!--Introduction-->
      <div class="introduction">
        <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

        We care about your privacy and data security, and we’ll never sell your data nor collect it without your consent. We understand that privacy is a major concern to our users, and we value your safety.
        <br /><br />
        This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application Jumper (“we”, “us”, “our”, or “the app”) access, uses, and maintains your personal data.
        <br /><br />
        Since Jumper is primarily monetized through non-personalized advertisements, we will need to process your personal information in order to offer you our Products and Services. By using Jumper or our related Products and Services, you hereby consent to this usage, and you confirm that you have read and agree to this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) and our Terms & Conditions. If you do not wish for us to collect or process your personal information as described herein, you have several choices including limiting the information we and our partners collect on you, or not using Jumper or our Products and Services.
        <br /><br />
        By using Jumper or our Products and Services, you acknowledge that we and our partners will use your data in the United States, Asia, Europe, Australia, or any other country were Jumper or our third-party partners operate. That is, our partners may process your data anywhere Google LLC or its agents maintain facilities, such as Google Cloud Platform locations or Google Data Center locations).
        <br /><br />
        This privacy policy complies with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and describes how we and our partners protect user data taken outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area. Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside.
      </div>

      <!--Who We Are-->
      <div class="who-we-are">
        <h2>2. WHO WE ARE</h2>

        Under applicable privacy laws, such as the GDPR, we operate as a “data-controller”, with various third-party partners, such as Google LLC, operating as “data-processors”. There are specific cases where Google is the data controller.
        <br /><br />
        Should you have any queries or concerns, contact Jamie Corkhill at Jamie.Corkhill@Live.com.

      </div>

      <!--How We Collect Information On You-->
      <div class="how-we-collect-information-on-you">
        <h2>3. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ON YOU</h2>
        In the course of providing you access to Jumper and our related Products and Services, we collect and receive personal information in a few ways. At any time, you can choose what information you provide, and can revoke consent, by accessing the relevant options within the application’s Settings menu.
        <br /><br />
        We store various information on your device in the course of normal usage, such as the time and date you last clicked on an ad, your in-app preferences, score related information, etc. None of this information is transferred off of your device apart from the timestamp with which you last clicked on an ad, as well as your generic scoring information, which are transmitted as “user properties” within the analytics service we use.
        <br /><br />
        The app itself does not open any internet connections, but it does use various services from Google which do themselves open internet connections and do lead to various personally identifiable information being transferred off your device. This is outlined below.
        <br /><br />
        In summary, Jumper does not attempt to read, transfer or store your personal data in any way, apart from through its use of various Google services.
        <br /><br />
        Jumper uses various services provided by Google LLC in its operation. These services do result in your data being transferred off of your device and sent to Google’s systems. If you are a user in the European Union, this almost certainly means that your data will be transmitted out of the EU or the EEA (“European Economic Area”).
        <br /><br />
        Please see the following pages for information about how Google LLC stores, uses, collects, and protects your data.

        <!--Google Firebase-->
        <div class="google-analytics-for-firebase">
          <h2>3.1 Google Analytics for Firebase</h2>
          Google Analytics for Firebase is “a free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement”. In the course of its normal operation, and unless consent is otherwise denied by the user, Jumper uses Google Analytics for Firebase to monitor how the application is performing and functioning, and to collect anonymous usage statistics that will allow us to improve our Products and Services.
          <br /><br />
          As an example, it would allow us to see how many people are using the app, view retention rates, understand how many users are moving to an updated version of the application, determine if the application is too hard or too easy (through transmission of your score), etc., via many different events that it collects, including one’s that we define. Google Analytics lets us aggregate these events in many ways.
          <br /><br />
          By default, and where applicable, Google Analytics for Firebase collects various anonymous information, such as your age bracket, gender, interests, etc., as well as the language used on your device, the store from which you downloaded and installed the application, your device brand, category, and model, etc., a full list of which may be found here (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6317486?hl=en).
          <br /><br />
          Google Analytics for Firebase transfers five items of personal data from your device to their systems, likely outside the EU:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Mobile Advertising ID
            </li>
            <li>
              IDFVs/Android IDs
            </li>
            <li>
              Instance IDs
            </li>
            <li>
              Analytics App Instance IDs
            </li>
            <li>
              IP Address
            </li>
          </ol>
          In the sections below, we describe the meaning of these terms, and the reasons for which they are used.

          <!--Mobile Advertsing ID-->
          <div class="ga-mobile-advertising-id mobile-advertising-id">
            <h2>3.1.a Mobile Advertsing ID</h2>
            The Mobile Advertising ID is an alphanumeric sequence, or string, representing a hexadecimal number.
            <br /><br />
            Unlike websites, mobile applications do not use Cookies. Instead, they rely on Mobile Advertising Identifiers. Typically, this ID is called an “Android Advertising ID”, or AdID, on Android devices, and an “Identifier for Advertisers”, or IDFA, on Apple devices.
            <br /><br />
            Mobile In-app Advertising IDs allow developers and marketers to track activity for advertising purposes. They’re also used to enhance serving and targeting capabilities.
            <br /><br />
            In Jumper’s operation, we don’t serve personalized ads, and subsequently, Mobile Advertising IDs are not used by our Ad Networks for that purpose. Instead, Mobile Ad IDs are used by Google Analytics for Firebase to determine a user’s demographics, interests, and approximate geo-location. In the case of Android, the Android Advertising ID is an “anonymous identifier for advertising purposes and enables users to reset their identifier or opt out of interest-based ads within Google Play apps.”
            <br /><br />
            It is based off of this ID that Google derives the aforementioned data, such as your age bracket, gender, device information, etc.
          </div>

          <!--IDFVs/Android ID-->
          <div class="idfvs-android-id">
            <h2>3.1.b IDFVs/Android ID</h2>
            The IDFVs (Identifier for Vendors), for Apple, is an alphanumeric string that is unique across devices.
            <br /><br />
            The Android ID is a 64-bit number, expressed as a hexadecimal string, that is unique to each combination of the app signing key, the user, and the device. It is used as a unique device identifier.
          </div>

          <!--Instance ID-->
          <div class="instance-id">
            <h2>3.1.c Instance ID</h2>
            The Instance ID is a unique identifier that identifies individual installations of an application and provides Google Firebase Services a method by which to refer to specific app instances. You can read more about Instance IDs here (https://developers.google.com/instance-id/).
            <br /><br />
            Google Analytics for Firebase uses Instance IDs to track particular audiences. Data associated with Instance IDs is not generally considered personally identifiable.
            <br /><br />
            This Instance ID is also used by our crash reporting service Crashlytics, which is discussed later.
          </div>

          <!--Analytics App Instance ID-->
          <div class="analytics-app-instance-id">
            <h2>3.1.d Analytics App Instance ID</h2>
            The Analytics App Instance ID is hexadecimal string that specifies you as a distinct user within Google Firebase, for it is unique to your installation of Jumper. It remains unchanged except when the app is restored onto a new device, the app is uninstalled and then reinstalled, or you clear app data.
          </div>

          <!--IP Address-->
          <div class="ga-ip-address ip-address">
            <h2>3.1.e Internet Protocol (IP) Address</h2>
            Google Analytics for Firebase collects your IP Address to derive or predict your location. It’s important to note that your IP Address never reaches Google’s systems, and as such, we, the data-controller, do not have access to view it, nor is it provided in our reports. Additionally, your IP Address is fully anonymized by Google at the earliest possible time. This is done to comply with relevant Internet privacy laws.
            <br /><br />
            We could use this information, for example, to view how many people in the United States were able to achieve a particular score, or how many people in the United Kingdom played the game for more than 10 minutes a day.
          </div>

          <!--Why the Data is Collected-->
          <div class="ga-why-the-data-is-collected why-the-data-is-collected">
            <h2>3.1.f Why the Data is Collected</h2>
            Jumper, and subsequently, we, partner with various third-party services such as Google Firebase to collect anonymous usage statistics about the function and performance of the application in order to improve it.
            <br /><br />
            Google Analytics uses this data to provide analytics and attribution information. The precise information collected can vary by the device and environment. For more information, see https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.
          </div>

          <!--Collected Data Retention Period-->
          <div class="ga-collected-data-retention-period collected-data-retention-period">
            <h2>3.1.g Collected Data Retention Period</h2>
            Google Analytics retains certain advertising identifier associated data (e.g., Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers and Identifier for Vendors, Android’s Advertising ID) for 60 days, and retains aggregate reporting and certain user-level campaign data without automatic expiration.
          </div>

          <!--Data Protection and Collection-->
          <div class="ga-data-protection-and-collection data-protection-and-collection">

        <!--Fabric Crashlytics-->
        <div class="fabric-crashlytics">
          <h2>3.2 Fabric Crashlytics</h2>
          Fabric is a mobile app developer platform that has been acquired by Google LLC. Crashlytics is a crash-reporting tool, now owned by Google, that provides developers with information pertaining to crashes and, when partnered with Google Analytics for Firebase, the events that may have caused said crash.
          <br /><br />
          Fabric Crashlytics, a subsidiary of Google LLC, transfers three items of data from your device to their systems, likely outside the EU:
          <ol>
            <li>

          Google AdMob is a mobile advertising company that serves advertisements, with the option of mediation, to application publishers. To provide our Products and Services for free, we rely on Google AdMob to generate revenue. Under the GDPR, Google acts as a “data controller” via AdMob, not a “data processor”.
          <br /><br />
          Google AdMob transmits the following information from your device.
          <ol>
            <li>

        To conform with COPPA (“Child’s Online Privacy Protection Act”), the GDPR (“General Data Protection Regulation”), and the polices of the Google Play Store Designed for Families (Mixed-Audiences) Program, we do not provide tailored or personalized advertising. Although non-personalized ads don’t use Mobile Ad IDs for ad targeting, they do still use Mobile Ad IDs for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse. Thus, by law, it is still required for us to attain consent for the use of the Mobile Ad ID in that regard.
