        <p>
          We are now collecting analytics data via Google Analytics for Firebase. <br><br>
          From the privacy policy introduction, we have removed the paragraph:
          <blockquote>
            Please note that at the time of writing, we do not partner with any third-party analytics or crash reporting services, and subsequently, we will not ask for consent to do so – since we won’t be collecting data. Please disregard any reference herein to “Google Analytics for Firebase”, “Google Firebase”, “Analytics”, “Fabric”, “Fabric Crashlytics”, or “Crashlytics”. We will be partnering with these services in a future update of Jumper, and at that time, this privacy policy will be revised to reflect that.
